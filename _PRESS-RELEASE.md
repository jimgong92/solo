There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Summary ##
  > Using information about the social network of the classroom, this program will produce the optimal schedule for pairing students in projects. The optimal schedule will be the one that minimizes the predicted bullying in the network. By minimizing bullying, you can foster a more comfortable environment for both the teacher and the students.

## Problem ##
  > Studies conducted on elementary school classrooms indicate that bullying is reduced by a statistically significant margin when bullies are within a geodesic of 2 (friend-of-a-friend status) of a potential victim within the peer network. Left unattended, youth peer networks continuously fragment over time, aggravating the existing bullying and creating more opportunities for bullying.

## Solution ##
  > Studies conducted on elementary school classrooms indicate that projects where students work in pairs reliably develop a friendly relationship where projects involving 3 or more students do not. Using given information about the current status of the classroom's social network, the program will process all the possible pair combinations in the impending group project schedule and return the optimal pairing schedule. 

## Quote from You ##

## How to Get Started ##
  > Fill out the data input fields regarding the social network of the classroom and simply submit the data.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Ever since I used this product, my classrooms have never been the same! I think of children as mean little creatures no longer!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Download Philotes and teaching will never be the same!
